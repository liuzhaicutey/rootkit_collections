A lot of people from my TikTok are dm'ing me for hacking services. But I just want to be transparent here, that I am just merely a software developer who just graduated recently, and had a knack for red-teaming tools and stuff. Some of these codes are made by me during my days in college, and I am editing and reuploading them. So no, I am not and WILL NOT do any kinds of services like that.

On the other hand was the one who mostly verify, test, and improve the tools that I upload here. They're like experienced and a lot more proficient with these "RED TEAM" tools, and probably someone you need when discussing these 'illicit' activities. They occasionally let me upload some of their experimental tools here, so if you had any problems or inquiries regarding the tools that we upload here, you can directly contact me OR Shaacidyne via telegram: https://t.me/Shaacidyne . But I doubt they will even respond since they're not really "online" these days (probably found a job or whatever).
